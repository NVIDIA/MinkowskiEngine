# Common Issues


## 1. Compilation failure due to incorrect `CUDA_HOME`

In some cases where your default CUDA directory is linked to an old CUDA version (MinkowskiEngine requires CUDA >= 10.0), you might face some compilation issues that give you **segmentation fault errors** during compilation.

```
NVCC ...
Segmentation fault
```

To confirm, you should check your paths.

```
$ echo $CUDA_HOME
/usr/local/cuda

$ ls -al $CUDA_HOME
..... /usr/local/cuda -> /usr/local/cuda-9.0

$ ls /usr/local/
bin cuda cuda-9.0 cuda-10.0 ...
```

In this case, make sure you set the environment variable `CUDA_HOME` to the right path and install the MinkowskiEngine.

```
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-10.0; python setup.py install
```


## 2. Compilation failure due to incorrect `CUDA_HOME`

Some applications modify the environment variable `CUDA_HOME` on your `.bashrc` see [#12](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MinkowskiEngine/issues/12).
This makes the pytorch CPPExtension module to fail leading to problems like `src/common.hpp:40:10: fatal error: cublas_v2.h: No such file or directory`.

If you encounter this issue, try to set your `CUDA_HOME` explicitly.

```
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda; python setup.py install
```

Or you can use the path to `nvcc` to automatically set the cuda home.

```
export CUDA_HOME=$(dirname $(dirname $(which nvcc))); python setup.py install
```


## Compilation failure due to Out Of Memory (OOM)

The `setup.py` calls the number of CPUs for multi-threaded parallel compilation. However, when installing the MinkowskiEngine on a cluster, sometimes the compilation might fail due to excessive memory usage. Please provide enough memory to the job for fast compilation. Another option when you have a limited memory is to compile without parallel compilation.

```
cd /path/to/MinkowskiEngine
make  # single threaded compilation
python setup.py install
```


## Compilation issues after an upgrade

In a rare case, you might face an compilation issue after you upgrade MinkowskiEngine, pytorch or CUDA. In general, when you get an undefined symbol error such (e.g., `_ZNK13CoordsManagerILh5EiE8toStringB5cxx11Ev`), or `thrust::system::system_error`, try to compile the entire library again using one of the following methods.

### Force compiling all object files

```
cd /path/to/MinkowskiEngine
make clean
python setup.py install --force
```


### From a new conda virtual environment

If above method doesn't work, try to create a new conda environment. We found that it sometimes solves the compilation issues.

```
conda create -n py3-mink-2 python=3.7 anaconda
conda activate py3-mink-2
conda install openblas numpy
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```

Then,

```
cd /path/to/MinkowskiEngine
conda activate py3-mink-2
make clean
python setup.py install --force
```


## CUDA Version mismatch: `undefined symbol` and `invalid device function`.

In some cases when the conda pytorch uses a different CUDA version, you might get an undefined symbol error or `CUDA error: invalid device function`.
Try to reinstall pytorch with the correct CUDA version that you are using to compile MinkowskiEngine.

To find out your CUDA version, run `nvcc --version`.

To install the correct CUDA libraries for anaconda pytorch, install `cudatoolkit=x.x` along with pytorch. For example,

```
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch
```

In this example, we assumed that you are using CUDA 10.1, but please make sure that you are installing the correct version. Then, use the following code snippet to create a new conda environment, and install MinkowskiEngine.

```
conda create -n py3-mink-2 python=3.7 anaconda
conda activate py3-mink-2
conda install openblas numpy
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch  # Make sure to use the correct cudatoolkit version

cd /path/to/MinkowskiEngine
conda activate py3-mink-2
make clean
python setup.py install --force
```
